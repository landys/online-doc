# OnlineDoc

It's a web application similar as Google Doc but much simpler. It's a course project (Grid Course) mainly in Java done by 2 guys in Nov 2007 when we were first-year graduate.

The main technology it used were GT4 (Globus Toolkit 4) and J2EE. The database was MySql, and the IDE we used was Eclipse.
